## Rust Notes
Before I committed my Rust notes to Github, something terrible happened.
I believe I deleted every single file while trying to organize everything into one Git repo.
I still do not know how, but what matters is that I had re-written every single file.
All of these files, are not the originals, but will still provide someone out there help, I hope.
If there are any concerns, or non-Rustcean syntax errors in my notes, please let me know.

These notes are a collection of my Rust Journey throughout my time learning Low-Level Programming.
Rust has to be the most difficult language I have ever learned, due to the lack of Classes, and static typing.
However, I perservered, and quite enjoy its syntax by this point, and have come to appreciate the simplicity of Classes.
