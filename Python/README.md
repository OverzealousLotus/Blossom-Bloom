### Foreword
These are a collection of notes and examples from my learning Journey with Python. I know how difficult it can be for people to start learning to code if it is their first time. While I learned, I put myself up to adding notes, or examples for everything I learned that day, week, or month. For now, I seek to add more comments to my code for readibility. Since, not all of my files contain notes, or concise descriptions of what is going on. Thank you to everyone who reads this! If there are any issues with this repository, feel free to say anything, or open up an issue for me to tackle on my free time.



### **TODO**
- Add more comments to files where necessary.
- Modernize comment style.
- Make some files more Pythonic
- Create my own examples for some files.
