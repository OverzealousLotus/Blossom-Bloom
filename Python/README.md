# Python

A collection of notes and examples from my learning Journey with Python. I know how difficult it can be for
people to start learning to code if it's their first time. So, while I learned, I put myself up to adding notes, or examples for everything I learned that day, week, or month. For now, I seek to add more comments to my code for readibility. Since, not all of my files contain explanations. Thank you to everyone who reads this! If there are any issues with this repository, feel free to say anything! 

##### **TODO**
- Finish adding Type Annotation to all files.
- Add more comments to files where necessary.
- Modernize comment style.
